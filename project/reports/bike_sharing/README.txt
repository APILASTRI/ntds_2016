The reader should only refer to the main file: Project_Main.ipynb
Other files are directly accessible from this main file.

N.B: The IPython modules attached to this project must be run in the same order as the main file.

2 IPython modules are extremely time consuming (about 30 mins each on my computer):
- create_sampled_data_each_station.ipynb
- regression_onemodel_all.ipynb
To avoid running them, the main file is loading a numpy array attached to this report.
